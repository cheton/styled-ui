# Alert

Alerts are used to communicate a state that affects a system, feature or page.

## Import

Trend Micro Styled UI exports 4 alert related components.

- `Alert`: The wrapper for alert components.
- `AlertIcon`: The visual icon for the alert that changes based on the `status`
  prop.
- `AlertTitle`: The title of the alert to be announced by screen readers.
- `AlertDescription`: The description of the alert to be announced by screen
  readers.

```js
import {
  Alert,
  AlertIcon,
  AlertTitle,
  AlertDescription,
} from '@trendmicro/react-styled-core/Alert';
```

## Usage

```jsx
<Alert status="error">
  <AlertIcon />
  <AlertTitle mr={2}>Your browser is outdated!</AlertTitle>
  <AlertDescription>Your Chakra experience may be degraded.</AlertDescription>
</Alert>
```

### Status

Change the status of the alerts by passing the `status` prop. This affects the
color scheme and icon used. Alert supports `error`, `warning`, and
`info` statuses.

```jsx
<Stack spacing=".5rem" shouldWrapChildren>
  <Alert status="error">
    <AlertIcon />
    There was an error processing your request
  </Alert>

  <Alert status="warning">
    <AlertIcon />
    Seems your account is about to expire, upgrade now!
  </Alert>

  <Alert status="info">
    <AlertIcon />
    Chakra is going live on August 30th. Get ready!
  </Alert>
</Stack>
```

### Composition

Alert ships with smaller component to allow for flexibility and make it easy to
create all kinds of layout. Here's an example of custom alert style and layout.

```jsx
<Alert
  status="info"
  flexDirection="column"
  justifyContent="center"
  textAlign="center"
  height="200px"
>
  <AlertIcon size="40px" mr={0} />
  <AlertTitle mt={4} mb={1} fontSize="lg">
    Application submitted!
  </AlertTitle>
  <AlertDescription maxWidth="sm">
    Thanks for submitting your application. Our team will get back to you soon.
  </AlertDescription>
</Alert>
```
