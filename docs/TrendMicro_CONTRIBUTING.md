We divide the Tonic UI contribution into two different periods:

### 1. Developing component in the project:

* During the project development, if there is a component or function that does not exist in the [Tonic UI](https://trendmicro-frontend.github.io/styled-ui/getting-started), please implement it by the project developer.

* Tonic UI is developed based on technologies such as [React](https://reactjs.org/), [React Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html), [Styled System](https://styled-system.com/), [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/), and [Emotion](https://emotion.sh/docs/introduction), so familiarity with these technologies is necessary.

* For the trace ticket when developing the component, please create it in the Jira system of the own project, and select the `vt-fed` tag in the TM Team field for effort management of contributions.

* If necessary, please frontend mentor help the member in developing the component.

### 2. Contributing component to Tonic UI:

* Once the component is developed, please separate it from the project and move it to the [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/) for review and discussion.

* Request a component contribution to [Tonic UI](https://trendmicro-frontend.slack.com/archives/C01R2AQR6TH), and then we will arrange for review and discussion.

* In addition to the quality and performance of the components, the "code review" also focuses on the scalability of functions.

* In addition to the component, it needs to be discussed how to present it on Tonic UI and the examples.
