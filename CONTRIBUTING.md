### ðŸš§ Contributing to Tonic UI Library ðŸš§ 
Looking to contribute something to Tonic UI? Here's how you can help.
Most of this contribution guide is Trend Micro internal only. If you are an engineer at Trend Micro, please take a moment to review this document in order to make the contribution process easy and effective for everyone involved.
Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of the developers managing and developing this open source project. In return, they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue or assessing patches and features.

## Using the issue tracker
The [issue tracker](https://github.com/twbs/styled-ui/issues) is
the preferred channel for [bug reports](#bug-reports), [features requests](#feature-requests)
and [submitting pull requests](#pull-requests), but please respect the following
restrictions:

* Please **do not** use the issue tracker for personal support requests.
  [Slack](https://bootstrap-slack.herokuapp.com/) or [IRC](README.md#community) are better places to get help.

* Please **do not** derail or troll issues. Keep the discussion on topic and
  respect the opinions of others.

* Please **do not** post comments consisting solely of "+1" or ":thumbsup:".
  Use [GitHub's "reactions" feature](https://blog.github.com/2016-03-10-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments/)
  instead. We reserve the right to delete comments which violate this rule.
